# backup_pics
Automatically backup pictures.

Created for Raspberry Pi 5 (RPi5) with 2 TB SSD.

Program automatically starts when RPi5 is booted.

When a known photo/video source, such as a cell phone or sd card,
is mounted via USB, copy images/videos from specified
folder(s) into a backup folder.

When a known external backup drive is attached to the RPi5, copy any new 
files from the backup folder on RPi5 to the external backup drive.

Multiple external backup drives can be used, such as a travel SSD 
and a home based magnetic hard drive.

Optionally, deleting pictures from the photo/video source can be done after photos have been
backed up to RPi5 or backed up to a given external backup drive.
